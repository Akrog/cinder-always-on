ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

---

# Cinder Architecture

## A.K.A "Initial fork out of Nova."

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture1.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Status reporting and volume creation flow.

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture2.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Management of existing volumes.

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture3.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## cinder-volume<->cinder-volume communication (e.g. migration).

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture4.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Host boundaries - local drivers: LVM, NFS, Block Device Driver (!)â€¦

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture5.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## cinder-backup service (optional).

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture6.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Pre-Mitaka flow - cinder-backup talks directly to backend (cinder-volume colocation).

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture7.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Post-Mitaka flow - cinder-backup communicates with cinder-volume.

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture8.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Post-Mitaka flow - cinder-bakup communicates with cinder-volume.

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture9.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Host boundaries - remote driver (e.g. Ceph): remote storage device/backend.

HIGH AVAILABILITY

---

# HA of Cinder services

## cinder-api

.left-column[
- Run multiple instances behind a HAProxy.
- Be advised of API race conditions in pre-Newton cinder-api.
]

.right-column[
![Insert graphic here](assets/ha/haproxy.svg)
]

---

# HA of Cinder services

## cinder-api race conditions

### Before

```python
vol = db.volume_get(ctxt, id)
if vol.status not in ('available', 'in-use'):
    db.volume_update(ctxt, id, status='retyping')
```

---

# HA of Cinder services

## cinder-api race conditions

### Before

```python
vol = db.volume_get(ctxt, id)
if vol.status not in ('available', 'in-use'):
    db.volume_update(ctxt, id, status='retyping')
```

### After

```python
expected = {'status': ('available', 'in-use')}
updates = {'status': 'retyping'}

if not volume.conditional_update(updates, expected, None):
    raise exception.InvalidVolume()
```

---

# HA of Cinder services

## cinder-scheduler

.left-column[
- You are be able to run multiple instances of cinder-scheduler in A/A fashion.
- Be advised that cinder-scheduler shares similar scaling issues as nova-scheduler.
]

.right-column[
![Insert graphic here](assets/ha/c-sch.svg)
]

---

# HA of Cinder services

## cinder-volume

TODO: To be extended by Gorka.

---

# HA of Cinder services

## cinder-backup

TODO: Gorka? Key talking points:
- Scalable backup service since Mitaka.
- Improvements related to c-vol A/A?

ROLLING UPGRADES

---

# Rolling Upgrades

## Elements

- Online DB migrations (DB compatiblity).
- RPC API versioning (communication API compatibility).
- oslo.versionedobjects (communication payload compatiblity).

---

# Rolling Upgrades

## Elements

- Online DB migrations (DB compatiblity).
- RPC API versioning (communication API compatibility).
- oslo.versionedobjects (communication payload compatiblity).

## Assumptions

- Upgrade order: cinder-api, cinder-scheduler, cinder-volume, cinder-bakup.
- No release skipping.
- Continuous deployment from master is allowed.
- You can achieve live upgrade only if you have a HA deployment.

# Rolling Upgrades

## Elements

- Online DB migrations (DB compatiblity).
- RPC API versioning (communication API compatibility).
- oslo.versionedobjects (communication payload compatiblity).

## Assumptions

- Upgrade order: cinder-api, cinder-scheduler, cinder-volume, cinder-bakup.
- No release skipping.
- Continuous deployment from master is allowed.
- You can achieve live upgrade only if you have a HA deployment.

## Advices
- Having each service deployed in container makes things easier.
- Make sure there are no stale records in `services` table.
- Read the release notes before starting.
