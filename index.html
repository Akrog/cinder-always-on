# Cinder Architecture

# Cinder Architecture

## cinder-volume<->cinder-volume communication (e.g. migration).

# Cinder Architecture

## Host boundaries - local drivers: LVM, NFS, Block Device Driver (!)…

# Cinder Architecture

## cinder-backup service (optional).

# Cinder Architecture

## Pre-Mitaka flow - cinder-backup talks directly to backend (cinder-volume colocation).

# Cinder Architecture

## Post-Mitaka flow - cinder-backup communicates with cinder-volume.

ROLLING UPGRADES

---

class: middle, center

# Allow Cinder deployments to be be upgraded in a live manner without introducing control plane or data plane downtime by letting the services to be upgraded one-by-one.

---

# Rolling Upgrades

## Internals

- Online DB migrations (DB compatiblity).
- RPC API versioning (communication API compatibility).
- oslo.versionedobjects (communication payload compatiblity).

## Assumptions

- Upgrade order: cinder-api, cinder-scheduler, cinder-volume, cinder-bakup.
- No release skipping.
  - X release keeps compatibility with X-1, but not with X-2.
- Continuous deployment from master is allowed.
  - But some commits may be required to upgrade to before moving on.
- You can achieve live upgrade only if you have a HA deployment.

---

# Rolling Upgrades

## Preliminary
* Having a container per service makes things easier.
* Make sure there are no stale records in `services` table.
* Read the release notes before starting.

## Upgrade steps (X to X+1)

2. Apply X+1 database migrations.
3. Upgrade your <strong>cinder-api</strong> services one-by-one.
4. Upgrade your <strong>cinder-scheduler</strong> services one-by-one.
5. Restart cinder-api services to make them detect new cinder-scheduler.
6. Upgrade your <strong>cinder-volume</strong> nodes one-by-one.
7. Restart cinder-api services and send SIGHUP to cinder-scheduler and cinder-volume services to make them detect new cinder-volumes.
8. Upgrade your <strong>cinder-backup</strong> services one-by-one.
9. Restart cinder-api services.
10. Apply online data migrations (<em>not there yet in Newton</em>).
