ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

---

# Cinder Architecture

## A.K.A "Initial fork out of Nova."

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture1.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Status reporting and volume creation flow.

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture2.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Management of existing volumes.

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture3.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## cinder-volume<->cinder-volume communication (e.g. migration).

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture4.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Host boundaries - local drivers: LVM, NFS, Block Device Driver (!)…

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture5.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## cinder-backup service (optional).

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture6.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Pre-Mitaka flow - cinder-backup talks directly to backend (cinder-volume colocation).

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture7.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Post-Mitaka flow - cinder-backup communicates with cinder-volume.

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture8.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Post-Mitaka flow - cinder-bakup communicates with cinder-volume.

.fill-width[![Insert graphic here](assets/architecture/architecture9.svg)]

---

# Cinder Architecture

## Host boundaries - remote driver (e.g. Ceph): remote storage device/backend.

TIPS & TRICKS

---

# Common Bottleneck

**Under heavy load operations take exponentially longer to complete**
  - Very visible in older releases
  - More visible on API only operations
  - Also affects non API operations

**Problem**
  - Bottleneck on DB connections ➔ Earlier releases 1000 to 15
  - People used to increase number of API workers

--

**Solution**
  - Configuration options
      - `wsgi_default_pool_size`: Available greenthread (1000 before, now 100)
      - `max_pool_size`: Maximum number of SQL connections to keep open. (5)
      - `max_overflow`: The maximum number of sleeping SQL connections. (10 before, now 50)
  - In Cinder it's important for all services

---

# Common Bottleneck (II)

.left-column[
**Defining proper values**

  - API recommendation: `wsgi_default_pool_size`=`max_overflow`
  - Cloud characterization
      - Use [Rally](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Rally) to run scenarios
      - Use [connmon](https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/connmon) to see connections
  - Adjust max connection on RDBMS servers: [post on how to calculate it](https://gorka.eguileor.com/os-db-connections)

**Additional Recomendation**

 - Use PyMySQL library for DB connections
 - Older default: MySQL-Python
     - Cannot be eventlet monekypatched
     - Blocks other greenthreads

# Stopping Cinder

**Basic questions**

- How should I stop cinder services?
- Will this do a clean stop?
- Is it the same for all Cinder services?
- What's this, SysAdmin 101?
- The answer is obvious, right?

```
  cinder service-disable --reason "Upgrade" host@backend cinder-volume
  sudo systemctl stop openstack-cinder-volume
```
???

We all want our services to stop cleanly

So we ask ourselves some basic questions like these ones

These may seem like obvious questions, but bear with me for a little bit

---

# Stopping Cinder

**Scenario**

- Cinder services are under heavy load
- We want to stop Cinder services ➔ Maintenance,Upgrade
- For explanation purposes order will be Scheduler, API, Volume

???

Situation would be very similar for normal upgrades

What we'll be discussing here also applies to other OpenStack services

--

**Scheduler**

- We stop the scheduler with `systemctl`
- Check resources and operations
--
  .green-text[**✓**]

--

**API**

- We stop the api with `systemctl`
- Check resources and operations
--
  .red-text[**✖**]
  - See failed Attach/Detach operations
  - Volumes stuck in *attaching/detaching* state
- What happened?

---

# Stopping Cinder - Services 101

- Check the systemd journal ➔ SIGTERM was sent to all processes
- Check the code ➔ Main process will also send SIGTERM to child processes

--
- Solution ➔ systemd.kill should not be sending SIGTERM to children
- /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/openstack-cinder-scheduler.service
  - `KillMode` is not defined ➔ defaults to *control-group*
  - Add `KillMode=process`

--

We try again and...  .red-text[**✖**]

- Fewer error cases ➔ only when *attach/detach* > 60 secs
- *attach/detach* are synchronous operations ➔  `rpc_response_timeout` is set to 80 seconds

```
● openstack-cinder-api.service - OpenStack Cinder API Server
   Active: failed (Result: signal) ...
  Process: 6837 ExecStart=[...] (code=killed, signal=ALRM)
 Main PID: 6837 (code=killed, signal=ALRM)
```

???

60 seconds is a long time, but as we mentioned earlier, if we don't set our DB connections right, it can happen

---

# Stopping Cinder - Timeout

**Oslo Service Shutdown process**

- systemd.kill sends SIGTERM to main process
- Main process asks services to `stop`
- Waits for services to stop for `graceful_shutdown_timeout` seconds
- If they don't stop ➔ SIGALRM

--

**Recommendation**

- `graceful_shutdown_timeout` defaults to 60 seconds
- `rpc_response_timeout` defaults to 60 seconds
- `graceful_shutdown_timeout` >= `rpc_response_timeout`

???

If we don't touch defaults, resources should not be affected by shutdown

---

# Stopping Cinder - API Service

.red-text[**But it still won't shutdown properly!!**]

```
● openstack-cinder-api.service - OpenStack Cinder API Server
   Active: failed (Result: signal) ...
  Process: 9368 ExecStart=[...] (code=killed, signal=KILL)
 Main PID: 9368 (code=killed, signal=KILL)
```

--

- There is a bug in eventlet.wsgi preventing WSGI server from stopping
- systemctl.kill escalated from `SIGTERM` to `SIGKILL`
  - After `TimeoutStopSec` (default: `DefaultTimeoutStopSec`)
  - `DefaultTimeoutStopSec`
      - Defined in /etc/systemd/system.conf
      - Default: 90 secs

???

Even if it's not a clean stop, it will not leave resources in the wrong state

---

# Stopping Cinder - Volume Service

**Cinder volume is in the data path**

- Performs long operations:
  - Creating volume from image
  - Migrating volume
- Insufficient default `graceful_shutdown_timeout`

--

**Solution**

- Increase timeouts to an arbitrary number
  - Difficult to decide good numbers
  - Depends on cloud, backend, workload...
- Prevent systemctl from sending kill signals
  - Manual process ➔ More tedious
  - More control

---

# Stopping Cinder - No auto-kill

  - Prevent systemctl.kill from sending `SIGKILL`
  - Change *openstack-cinder-volume.service*
```
ExecStop=/bin/kill -SIGTERM $MAINPID
KillMode=none
```
  - Stop request ➔ `systemctl stop openstack-cinder-volume`
  - Check resource status progress
```
mysql cinder -e "
select id,status,display_name from volumes
where not deleted and
      status not like 'error%' and status not in ('available', 'in-use')
      and host like '`hostname`%';"
```
  - Force stop ➔ `systemctl kill -s SIGKILL`

---

# Stopping Cinder - Summary

**Checklist**

- Check your service definitions
  - `KillMode=process`
- Properly set timeouts:
  - `TimeoutStopSec` > `graceful_shutdown_timeout`
  - `graceful_shutdown_timeout` >= `rpc_response_timeout`
- Careful consideration with volume service
- Reload your service configurations
  - After making changes
  - Before stopping your service
  - `systemctl daemon-reload`

# Changing Log Levels

## Without service interruption

# Service down detection

How does the service down detection work?

- Cinder uses DB heartbeats
- Services report every `report_interval` seconds (default 10)
- Down if report older than `service_down_time` seconds (default 60)
- Fastest detection
  - Reducing `service_down_time` value
  - Be careful with transient DB issues
  - Increase report frequency
  - Leads to increment in DB queries

???

This is part of the basics, but I still get asked about it sometime
